Ideas:
Make styling more like a darkmode
Style story entries in less compact way, maybe use some component library like MUI.
Infinite scroll and fire off API calls to load more stories based on user scrolling

Table structure:

Body
    center
        table
            tr (Hacker News Banner)
                ...
            tr (all table contents)
                td
                    table 
                        tbody
                            tr (story title /link / votes)
                            tr (story points, author, comments link)
                            tr (spacer)
                            ...repeat for each story




Styling:

Main table body: id: hnmain
First Row = header, wonder if we can add a css id to it for styling.
